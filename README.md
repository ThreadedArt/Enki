# Enki
Enki aims to become a unique server based around fantasy with roleplaying elements.

# Why? Do this are you stupid?
Seeing i was asked no i'm not stupid just rather bored of the overly custom servers loading osrs cache not the original rs2 cache. I see it as a hobby paired with happiness.

Wait how old is the server and what base is it? Oh didn't i mention we are redoing something very very old and yes it may be a bit dumb but its my life to waste.

# Tasks
 The following tasks are to get started while working on this server we aim to be Java 17 Compatiable as our client is also Java 17 Compatiable already and is loading the 377 cache like most debobs.
 
 -- Sever packaging
 -- Linux Friendly changes ( our client has already been updated and tested to work on Windows, Mac and Linux )
 -- Quality Of Life
 -- Using Java Conventions for all parts of the server
 -- Unique Skills ( already made parts of them just starting over)
 -- create an ingame theme for the whole server similar to roleplay
 -- add libaries for voting, donation and high scores
 -- Remove all things over itemID 7900 bascially no new items unless required for the games roleplaying and overall theme
 
 # Whats an enki?
 
 Googles Example?
 
 Enki was the Sumerian god of wisdom, fresh water, intelligence, mischief, healing, creation, fertility, and art. His intelligent magic often included trickery to benefit the good of the human race. Enki is portrayed as a loving and caring god who uses his wisdom to find the best solution in every situation.
